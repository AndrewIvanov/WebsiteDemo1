MasterPageMain.master is the master page that all other pages are created from (in order to have this content span across all pages as this is one of the main reasons for having master pages). In this example it is primarily for the common Navigation bar across all pages. 

Home.aspx is the main start page for this project and where various design elements are included: <br>
Scrolling on event click to certain locations in the page. <br>
CSS transitions for various effects, the noteable ones on mouse hover over object border manipulations occur (sliding and highlight).

SQL Server Database is included here but no functionality implement in this project. For some standard functionality with a SQL Server database checkout the CRUD1 Repo.
